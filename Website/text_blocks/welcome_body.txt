This a completely free, no ads, non-profit, community league and player finding website “club”, for owners of the brilliant and realistic table tennis simulation game, Racket Fury VR on the Playstation VR. 

You can find and contact players on your local sever to arrange friendly matches and challenge them in leagues which are specially structured into box divisions to satisfy all playing standards from top players to absolute beginners.  You always have a chance to win in your division as each season renews every three weeks.

You can view the players list and arrange friendly matches without registering.

However, by registering, you can add yourself to the player list and message other players directly through this website mediating messaging system (your email address will always remain private) and of course you can take part in leagues.
